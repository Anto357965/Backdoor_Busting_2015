I'm not havin' it.

I'm fed up with the ammount of GMod backdoors/server takeovers I keep finding.
This is a database of all the ones I've found in GMod workshop addons etc.

This information should help people trying to protect their servers from this crap.

See the folders for information about each one.


./BD001_gpwn_new - gpwn backdoor, quite complex.
