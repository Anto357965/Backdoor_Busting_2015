### READ THE CODE YOU INSTALL ON YOUR SERVERS. I ACCEPT NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE SCRIPTS ON THIS DATABASE!

#### It's been brought to my attention that some people are abusing the backdoors in this database for their own benefit (By getting the raw Lua scripts through GitHub's API and executing them.) so just a heads up for you guys, make sure to read over all the code you run or are given to run on your server.

I'm not havin' it.

I'm fed up with the ammount of GMod backdoors/server takeovers I keep finding.
This is a database of all the ones I've found in GMod workshop addons etc.

This information should help people trying to protect their servers from this crap.

You should read and understand all code you run on your servers.
DO NOT TRUST THE WORKSHOP. Scripts can update silently and add backdoors.

See the folders for information about each one.


EDIT 2016:
It seems a few clientside GMod hacks now have backdoors too..
