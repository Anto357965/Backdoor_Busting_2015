I'm not havin' it.

I'm fed up with the ammount of GMod backdoors/server takeovers I keep finding.
This is a database of all the ones I've found in GMod workshop addons etc.

This information should help people trying to protect their servers from this crap.

You should read and understand all code you run on your servers.
DO NOT TRUST THE WORKSHOP. Scripts can update silently and add backdoors.

See the folders for information about each one.


./BD001_gpwn_new 				- gpwn backdoor, quite complex.
./BD002_Underdone			 	- "Underdone" backdoor/DRM annoyance script.
./BD003_rp_nexusgrad_v1_winter	- rp_nexusgrad_v1_winter map backdoor.
./BD004_ThirdPersonController	- Third Person Controller backdoor / Server takeover.
