Another crappy backdoor.

Discovered @ 27.11.16

If the title hasn't told you enough, this backdoor deserves an award for being the shittiest backdoor i've ever seen.

**Q0hxcVDH.lua: A copy+paste of the BD018_AfterShock_Gaming "mememachine" backdoor.**

**AW92zVAi.lua: Basically just adds the player to the user group "superadmin" when you run the command "PlayerSpawn" in your console.**
