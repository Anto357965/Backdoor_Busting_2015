Another crappy backdoor.

Discovered @ 27.11.16

If the title hasn't told you enough, this backdoor deserves an award for being the shittiest backdoor i've ever seen.

Basically just adds the player to the user group "superadmin" when you run the command "PlayerSpawn" in your console.

##### *These backdoors just keep getting worse and worse...*
